# Happyr developer blog

Find the blog here: http://developer.happyr.com/

We use this Jekyll theme: https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/

Make sure not to run <b>bundle exec jekyll serve --watch </b> in your editors terminal,
that will produce an error. Run it in your external terminal instead.
