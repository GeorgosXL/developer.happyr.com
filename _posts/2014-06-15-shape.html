<p>Hack introduced a concept called Shapes. It is an object like the associative PHP array but with predefined array keys. If you are familiar with C you might think of a shape like a struct. So what is the use case for this? Why should we complicate things with Shapes when we already doing fine with arrays?</p>
<p>The main drawbacks of using arrays are that you can’t type check the array values and you can’t be sure if an array key is defined. </p>
<p>[php]</p>
<p>type HtmlTag = shape('name'=&gt;string, 'count'=&gt;int);</p>
<p>function printInfo(HtmlTag $tag): void {<br />
  echo &quot;We found &quot;.$tag['count'].&quot; tags of type &quot;.$tag['name'];<br />
}</p>
<p>printInfo(shape('name'=&gt;'h2', 'count'=&gt;3));</p>
<p>[/php]</p>
<p>To define a shape you use the <strong>type</strong> or <strong>newtype</strong> keyword. They follow the same rules as the type aliasing. If you use newtype when defining a shape it will only be valid in the same file. You will get Hack errors if you are trying to use the shape in another file. </p>
<p>Likewise if you define a shape with two integers and you use it with string you will hear Hack complain. But the code will run on HHVM.  Because in HHVM a shape is just an array and arrays don’t have types. </p>
<h2>Generics</h2>
<p>You may define your shapes with generics. It works exactly as you may expect. =)<br />
[php]<br />
type Point&lt;T&gt; = shape ('x' =&gt; T, 'y' =&gt; T);<br />
[/php]</p>
