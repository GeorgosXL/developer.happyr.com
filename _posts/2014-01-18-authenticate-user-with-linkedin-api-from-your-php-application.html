<p>Recently I wanted to let my users authenticate with LinkedIn. We had just added a Facebook and Twitter authentication, so why not LinkedIn. To my big surprise there were no <strong>LinekdIn API clients for PHP</strong>. At least no good ones. And the code samples from <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/code-samples">developer.linkedin.com</a> where lookting pretty nasty. So, as a good open source developer I decided to build one and share it.</p>
<h2>My LinkedIn API client</h2>
<p>With inspiration from the Facebook PHP SDK I came up with a solution that hides all the nasty stuff from the code samples. Click here to review and download my <a href="https://github.com/HappyR/LinkedIn-API-client">LinkedIn PHP Api client</a>. I wanted to focus on these three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy to implement</li>
<li>Easy to extend</li>
<li>Easy to test</li>
</ol>
<p>So how do you use it? Study this code example and tell me in the comments what you think:</p>
<p>[php]<br />
&lt;?php<br />
//index.php</p>
<p>//make sure you have included composers autoload.php before you begin.<br />
$linkedIn=new HappyR\LinkedIn\LinkedIn('app_id', 'app_secret');</p>
<p>//if not authenticated<br />
if (!$linkedIn-&gt;isAuthenticated()) {<br />
    $url = $linkedIn-&gt;getLoginUrl();<br />
    echo &quot;&lt;a href='$url'&gt;Login with LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&quot;;<br />
    exit();<br />
}</p>
<p>//we know that the user is authenticated now<br />
$user=$linkedIn-&gt;get('v1/people/~:(firstName,lastName)');</p>
<p>echo &quot;Welcome &quot;.$user['firstName'];</p>
<p>[/php]</p>
