<p>A tuple is very similar to a PHP array and a shape. The key feature of tuples is that they are immutable. You may not change the length or the types of the elements in a tuple. The values within the tuple are mutable.<br />
[php]<br />
public function test(): void {<br />
    $tup = tuple('3', 2, 4, 'foo');<br />
    //change the 4th element<br />
    $tup[3] = 'bar';<br />
    //add a new element, this will make the type checker scream<br />
    $tup[5] = 'Baz';<br />
}</p>
<p>[/php]</p>
<p>If you are trying to add more values to a tuple you will hear Hack complain, but the code will run on HHVM. The implementation of tuples is actually a pure array. This is the current implementation:<br />
[php]<br />
function tuple(...) {<br />
  return func_get_args();<br />
}<br />
[/php]</p>
<p>The best use case I can see for tuples are when you need to return multiple values from a function. Notice how I annotate the return type.<br />
[php]<br />
public function foo(): (string, int) {<br />
    $tup = tuple(&quot;Hello&quot;, 3);</p>
<p>    return $tup;<br />
}<br />
[/php]</p>
<p>This is easier to write than using shapes for the same purpose. </p>
<p>Since a tuple is an immutable collection with fixed length, it kind of covers all the use cases for a <a href="http://developer.happyr.com/why-collections" title="Why collections?">Pair</a>. The only difference is that a tuple is a data type and the Pair is an object. Why would you ever want to use a Pair when you can use the quick and easy solution with tuples?</p>
