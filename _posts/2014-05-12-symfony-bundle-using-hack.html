  content: "Actually no. Everything made perfectly sense. But you really have to know
    what you are doing. If you know Java or C# you will have no trouble learning Hack.
    \r\n\r\nOne thing that was weird before I understood what I was doing was when
    I tried to implement an Interface. \r\n\r\n[php]\r\n//PHP file\r\ninterface Foo
    { public function baz($text); }\r\n//Hack file\r\nclass Bar implements Foo { public
    function baz(string $text): void {} }[/php]\r\n\r\nThe code above is invalid.
    At a first glance i thought that Hack classes could not implement PHP interfaces.
    But that is wrong. They can. The problem here is that Foo::baz only takes string.
    That is a narrower declaration then what the interface states. You have to change
    it to:\r\n[php]//Hack file\r\nclass Bar implements Foo { public function baz(mixed
    $text): void {} }[/php]"

<p>I've been working with the <a href="http://www.symfony.se">Symfony.se</a> website the last couple of weeks. In a discussion on Github we argued how a nice excerpt should look like. We decided that the excerpt twig filter should take a HTML string as input and make it shorter without breaking the HTML. It should also remove tables and convert headings.</p>
<p>Since Symfony.se runs on HHVM I decided to write the Twig filter in Hack. The bundle is not optimized or optimal, it is written to demonstrate some cool Hack features. You will find the bundle <a href="http://developer.happyr.com/symfony2-bundles/excerpt-bundle">here</a> and the cool hack features is found in <a href="https://github.com/HappyR/ExcerptBundle/blob/master/Service/HackExcerpt.php" target="_blank">this file</a>. I wanted to make sure you could run the symfony.se website on a normal PHP installation as well. So I added two excerpt services. One written in PHP and one written in Hack. In the dependency injection configuration I made a check if HACK_VERSION is defined to decide which service to load.</p>
<p>If you want to try the Hack bundle with the symfony.se project I recommend you reading my post about <a title="Try Hack and HHVM" href="http://developer.happyr.com/try-hack-and-hhvm">how to install HHVM and Hack</a>.</p>
<h2>What to look at</h2>
<p>When you are reading the <a href="https://github.com/HappyR/ExcerptBundle/blob/master/Service/HackExcerpt.php">HackExcerpt class</a> pay extra attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first rows declaring the Heading shape</li>
<li>the constructor</li>
<li>the method declaration of <em>getDefaults</em></li>
<li>the <em>preg_replace_callback</em> function in <em>convertHeadings</em></li>
</ul>
