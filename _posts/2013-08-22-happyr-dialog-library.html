<p>I know there is plenty of javascript libraries that help you show dialogs. I've used a handful of them and I've read the documentation of many more. Many of them was okey but none was awesome. That's why I built my own.</p>
<p>At the time of writing is the latest version is 1.3.3 and I think I've made a decent job. I had 4 things in mind when I wrote the dialog:</p>
<ul>
<li>responsive design</li>
<li>built for Ajax</li>
<li>highly configurable</li>
<li>I don't want to force the user to write tons of code</li>
</ul>
<p>The two later are the most important ones. I want the dialog to popup without me writing code to describe how it should behave. But I want to be able to configure the dialog with some default values and of course should these values be overridden if I want to. </p>
<p>I've tried to make things simple for the user because dialogs should not be complicated. </p>
<p>The source code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/HappyR/HappyR-Dialog">Github</a>. To see examples and documentation click <a title="jQuery HappyR Dialog" href="http://developer.happyr.se/libraries/jquery-happyr-dialog">here</a>. </p>
