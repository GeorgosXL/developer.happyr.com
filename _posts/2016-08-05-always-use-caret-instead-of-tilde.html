  content: Take that conclusion with a grain of salt. Not all packages are following
    semver, in those cases, a tilde can be useful.

<p>I've been noticing people having trouble understanding the differences between the caret ("^") and the tilde ("~") operator in the composer.json file. Composer's documentation is great but a bit short, that is why I write this blog post.</p>
<p>Composer assumes that all packages are using Semver. It is an easy version schema that consists of a major.minor.patch version. A major version breaks backwards compatibility, minor version introduces new features and patch versions are bug fixes.</p>
<p>The tilde operator is best explained by example. Notice that it actually makes a difference if you specify the patch version or not.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
~1.0   means &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0 same as 1.*<br />
~1.0.0 means &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;1.1.0 same as 1.0.*<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>The caret operator follows Semver.</p>
<p>[code]</p>
<p>^1.0   means &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0 same as 1.*<br />
^1.0.0 means &gt;=1.0.0 &lt;2.0.0 same as 1.*<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>What is little less known is that Semver behaves differently on versions under 1.0.0. Before the project has a stable release, minor versions are allowed to break backwards compatibility. This is dangerous when you use the tilde operator since you may get update that breaks backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
// This is dangerous as updates might break BC<br />
~0.2 means &gt;=0.2.0 &lt;1.0.0</p>
<p>// This is fine<br />
~1.2 means &gt;=1.2.0 &lt;2.0.0<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>A workaround for this could be that you always specify versions under 1.0.0 with an asterisk ("*").</p>
<p>[code]<br />
0.2.* means &gt;=0.2.0 &lt;0.3.0<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>A better approach is to continue to use the caret operator as it still respects Semver even on versions under 1.0.0.</p>
<p>[code]<br />
^0.2 means &gt;=0.2.0 &lt;0.3.0<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>In conclusion: One should always use caret ("^") over tilde ("~") because caret is always respecting Semver.</p>
